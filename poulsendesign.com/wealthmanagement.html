            <h2 class="margintop36">Background Context</h2>
            <p>The bank faces a significant challenge in providing Wealth Management Advisors with efficient and accessible tools to monitor their clients’ portfolio health and account details. The absence of such tools has created a gap in the bank’s service offering, impacting the quality of relationship between advisors and their clients. Consequently, there is an increasing need for the bank to implement effective solutions that enable WM clients to monitor and manage their accounts more efficiently in a user-friendly way.
            </p>
            <h2 class="margintop36">The Problem</h2>
            <h3>WM Advisors and their clients lack a digital experience that allows them to easily and efficiently monitor and manage their Wealth accounts.
            </h3>
            <div>
                <strong>My Role</strong>
                <p>I worked on this project as the lead Product Designer alongside a UX Strategist. My responsibility was to conduct discovery research, identify opportunity areas, and design a prototype experience based on our findings.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>Target Users</strong>
                <p>The target users are Wealth Management Advisors and their Private Banking clients. Private Banking clients are those who have a minimum of $1M in investible assets. They are considered premium clients, and have different touchpoints (and subsequent user needs) with the bank than a typical relationship client.

            <ul>
                <li>Receive internal funding to develop WM Advisor dashboard</li>
                <li>Increase online engagement with WM client base for KPB accounts</li>
                <li>Client retention & relationship quality</li>

                <p>Based on the SME knowledge, user interviews, and competitive analysis, my team began creating design solutions. We developed a working process to rapidly iterate and refine the dashboard design. We each created our own independent iterations and used them to A/B test with users.</p>

                <p>A/B Testing helped us get quick and insightful feedback that ensured a user-driven design outcome.</p>
                <p>We used the testing session to identify the strengths of each design. The results of the test showed us that the design of Option 1 was unanimously preferred, but it lacked the "Holdings" module that Option 2 had.</p>
                <p>We regrouped and combined the successful features of our independent iterations into a new, revised mockup.</p>

            <h3>Successes and Setbacks</h3>
            <p>Our final deliverables were met with positive feedback all-around. The design was successful by all user-centered performance metrics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased stakeholder support for funding to develop the prototype.</li>
                <li>Usability tests showed an increase in ease-of-use from the existing management experience.</li>
                <li>Currently undergoing final usability testing sessions with clients.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The largest setback we faced was development priorities. Some features (Bank news, Investment news, and Top/Bottom movers) were deprioritized by stakeholders for the MVP experience. Although our research proves the positive impact of these features for the user experience, they may not make it into the first iteration of MVP due to development timeline priorities.</p>
            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>From this experience, I’ve learned the importance of uncovering constraints early on in the discovery process. It’s important to dig deeper past the initial constraints that stakeholders present, since there are typically other constraints being overlooked, such as development priorities.</p>
